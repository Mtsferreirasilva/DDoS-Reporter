Developed by Mateus Ferreira Silva this project had as theme implement a DoS/DDoS monitor for the web server Apache.\r\n\r\n### Main topics (basics functionalities)\r\n\r\n- Implement a real time DoS/DDoS monitor for the web server Apache. The program should periodically read the access logs of the web server, and in case of anomalies (mass access), detect the IP or IPs involved in the attack.\r\n- When an attack is detected, it should sent an email to the network administrator (given in the configuration file) warning that a DoS or DDoS attack is ongoing and the IPs involved.\r\n- In the configuration file should be possible to determine, in addition to information such as email, if the IP(s) that is(are) conducting the attack is(are) going to be blocked by a _DROP_ rule of _iptables_.\r\n\r\n## How to use\r\n\r\n1. Configure the file _settings.py_ with the right information\r\n1. Execute the file _ddos_reporter.py_\r\n\r\nThose files are located inside the _ddosreporter_ folder\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
